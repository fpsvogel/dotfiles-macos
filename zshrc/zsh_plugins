# My Zsh plugins.
# Essentially I've moved the plugins section of .zshrc over to
# here so that I can easily apply them on a different machine.

# Community plugins must first be installed.

# - zsh-syntax-highlighting:
#     https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md

# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh_CUSTOM/plugins/
# NOTE: must first run:
#   git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
